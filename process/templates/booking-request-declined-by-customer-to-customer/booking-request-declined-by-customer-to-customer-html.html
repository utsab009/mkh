      The Mentoring Meeting for {{> format-date date=booking.start}} to {{> format-date
      date=booking.end}} has been successfully cancelled. If the meeting was more than 48 hours from
      the time of the meeting this cancellation is free of charge. If the cancellation was within 48
      hours from the time of the meeting, then you will be charged the full amount as per the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://mentorkh.herokuapp.com/terms-of-service"
        >terms of services</a

      of Try A Mentor. The only exception is if your Mentor did not confirm your meeting. In such
      cases, it is free to cancel at any point up to the start of the meeting. We very much hope
      that you will consider booking a Mentor again on Try A Mentor. Thanks for considering this
      service in the first place.
