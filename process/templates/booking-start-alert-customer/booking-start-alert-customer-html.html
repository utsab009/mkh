    <p>Hi {{customer.display-name}},</p>
    <p>
      This is a gentle and hopefully useful reminder that your Mentor Meeting with Andy T will
      commence from {{> format-date date=booking.start}} to {{> format-date date=booking.end}}.
    </p>
    <p>We hope it is a great success</p>

    <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #032264;">No Skype Address?</p>
    <p>
      If you cannot see the Mentor's Skype address above, they have failed to supply it. You will
      need it so please get if from them by typing a message to your Mentor. To do this, log into
      your account on TryaMentor.com, right beside the circle in the top right-hand corner of your
      screen is a link called Bookings / Inbox. Click this and then click the message from the
      Mentor in which they accepted your Mentoring request. Here you can send the mentor a message
      asking for their Skype address

    <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #032264;">A Great Way to Avoid or Solve Problems</p>
    <p>
      Before your meeting is scheduled to start, open Try A Mentor, sign-in and go to your Inbox (if
      you are the Mentee go to 'From Mentors' section of your inbox, if you are the Mentee go to
      'From mentees' section of the inbox). You can type a message to your Mentor / Mentee to say
      you are about to connect, and they can reply in real time. This way you are telling the other
      person you are ready and waiting and if either of you run into problems, the other person can
      offer help.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not sure how to get Skype set-up, remember your Mentor is here to help, so again,
      through your Try A Mentor inbox, send them messages asking for help and combine the advice
      given with the many 'how to' videos you will find on the internet (just google â€“ how to set up
      and use Skype). Do this well in advance of the meeting.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #032264;">
      Have a wonderful and enriching Mentoring meeting!
    </p>
