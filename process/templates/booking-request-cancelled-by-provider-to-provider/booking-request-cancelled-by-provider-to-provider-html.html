      The Mentoring Meeting for {{> format-date date=booking.start}} to {{> format-date

      May we suggest that you contact this person as soon as possible to explain why you had to
      cancel and to request they book you for alternative time (if they have not already done so).
      To do this, sign into TryaMentor.com, then look to the top right-hand corner of the screen.
      There you will see Bookings / Inbox. Then scroll down to the last message from the person.
      Click here and you will be able to write them a message asking them to book you again on
      TryaMentor.com. Good luck!
    </p>
