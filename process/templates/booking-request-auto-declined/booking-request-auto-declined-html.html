      of reasons as to why this has occurred, for example the Mentor is currently away and not
      checking their e-mails to a technical fault that the Mentor is having etc. Please know you
      have not been billed. You can try booking this Mentor again or find a new one (if you have not
      already done so) through the link in blue below. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
