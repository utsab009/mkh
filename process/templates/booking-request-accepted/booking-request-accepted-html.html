      What Happens Next / How do I meet with my Mentor?
    </p>
    <p>
      You will meet your Mentor by contacting them at the above start time through the following
      Skype address:
    </p>

    <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #032264;">Mentors Skype address to appear here</p>
    {{#if protected-data.link}}
    <a style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 700" href="skype:{{protected-data.link}}?chat"
      >Meeting Link: skype:{{protected-data.link}}?chat
    </a>
    {{else}}
    <p style="font-size:20px; color: blue;">
      Your Mentor has yet to give us their Skype address. Please contact them well before your
      meeting date to request it by signing into TryAMentor.com, clicking on the circle with your
      picture or initials in it (top right hand corner of the screen) and go to your inbox (from
      Mentors). Here you can write messages to your Mentor and in this case ask them to provide
      their Skype address
    </p>
    {{/if}} {{/with}}
    <p>
      Your computer, tablet or mobile phone / cell will need access to effective internet speed
      along with having a camera, speakers, and microphone (they tend to be built into modern mobile
      phones / cells, tablets, and computers).
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 700;  color: #032264;">
      A Great Way to Avoid or Solve Problems
    </p>
    <p>
      Before your meeting is scheduled to start, open Try A Mentor, sign-in and go to your Inbox
      (From Mentors). You can type a message to your Mentor to say you are about to connect, and
      they can reply in real time. This way they can offer help if you run into any problems. If you
      are not sure how to get Skype set-up, remember your Mentor is here to help from this point
      forward, so again, through your Try A Mentor inbox, send them messages asking for help and
      combine the advice given with the many 'how to' videos you will find on the internet (just
      google 'how to set up and use Skype').
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #032264;">Need to Postpone or Cancel the Meeting</p>
    <p>
      Remember you can cancel at no cost up to 48 hours before the meeting but within 48 hours you
      will be charged the full fee with one exception. The exception is, If you book the meeting
      within the 48 hours period (e.g. you book a meeting for the next day) you can get a refund if
      you cancel within 15 minutes of when you made the booking. You can cancel three times a year
      and will receive a full refund but from the fourth time onwards, Try A Mentor reserves the
      right to retain the Try A Mentor administration fee.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 700; color: #032264;">
      Have a wonderful and enriching Mentoring meeting!
