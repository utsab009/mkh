      <p>
        At Try A Mentor we make every effort to protect the data which you provide to us. We
        consistently monitor our servers for unauthorised access, and we have appropriate security
        management systems in place to safeguard this. Anti-virus software and Firewalls are
        installed on all areas of the site. If we ask anyone else to do some work for us on our
        websites or servers, we ensure they have the same prominent levels of security in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do recognise however that, unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be

      <h2>IP Addresses and Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Like most other websites we will collect information about your computer including, if
        available, your IP Address, Operating System, Browser Type and Location for statistical and
        behavioural tracking. This information helps us to enhance our service to you. This does not
        identify any individual; it is used as a tool to gather broad levels of data for analysis
        and to measure audience size and patterns of usage such as visitor numbers and how unique
        they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect a cookie file for the same reason. These are small files that a site or
        service provider transfers to your hard drive through your browser which essentially enables
        us to remember certain non-identifiable information. You can disable cookies through
        Internet Options on your browser menu at any time.

        Analytics. You can find further information on the information which it collects at
        http://www.google.com/analytics/.

        browser type you accessed with and the operating system.
